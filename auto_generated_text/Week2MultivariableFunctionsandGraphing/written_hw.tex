\section{Written Homework}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function
\[
f(x,y,z) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{9-x^2-y^2-z^2}}.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the domain of $f$? Describe this domain as a region in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
\item What is the range of $f$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function 
\[
f(x) = x^2 + y^2 - 4.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw at least five level curves of $f$.
\item Use these level curves to sketch the graph of $f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Draw the graph of the surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ determined by the equation
\[
x = y^2/4 - z^2/9.
\]
Use level curves and/or sections to justify why your drawing is correct.
\end{problem}

\section{Professional Problem}

\begin{problem}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by
\[
g(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2.
\]
Draw at least three level surfaces of $g$, which will be surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. What do you notice about these level surfaces?
\item Suppose you have a function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ depends on $x$ and $y$, but does not depend on $z$. What can you say about the level surfaces of $g$? 
\item Suppose you have a function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ depends on $y$ and $z$, but does not depend on $x$. What can you say about the level surfaces of $g$? 
\item Suppose you have a function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ depends on $x$, but does not depend on $y$ or $z$. What can you say about the level surfaces of $g$?
