Note: be sure to follow exact formatting. Each week consists of title, followed by TOPICS, and the path for each topic on its own line.
Then ONLINE HOMEWORK, with paths for problems each on their own line.
Then WRITTEN HOMEWORK, with paths for problems each on their own line.
Then PROFESSIONAL HOMEWORK, with paths for problems each on their own line.
Empty lines indicate breaks between weeks, so don’t add any extra new lines.
There should be only one empty line between groups.
Make sure you don’t have an extra empty line at the end.
Headings (e.g. ONLINE HOMEWORK) must be present, even if there isn’t any homework.
You can add notes here if needed - anything before the line containing only “TITLE” will not be read.
