<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we introduce the moving frame of a path in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>, which is also called the
TNB frame. This is a set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors (an
orthonormal set) which provide a consistent reference frame for a particle moving
along a path.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Imagine yourself walking around, and think about the following three directions:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">the direction that you’re looking (“ahead”),
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">the direction that your head is pointing (“up”),
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">the direction to your right (“right”).</li></ul>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Together, the directions “ahead,” “up,” and “right” define your own, personal
reference frame. You can describe locations relative to your reference frame:

<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >“the classroom is up a floor, three doors ahead, and on the right.”</p></div>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >However, relative to the rest of the universe, these directions change as you walk
                                                                  

                                                                  
around. If you turn around to face in the opposite direction, ahead and right would
be pointing in the opposite directions that they were before. If you fly across
the world to Australia, the up direction is now in a different direction. So,
this frame of reference is unique to your position, and how you are moving
around.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Our goal is to define a similar reference frame for a particle moving along a path in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>,
which will consist of three orthonormal vectors.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Defining the moving frame</h3>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >Suppose we have a path <script type="math/tex">\vec {x}(t)</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>, and we want to define a reasonable reference frame for a
particle moving along this path, which will consist of three mutually orthogonal unit
vectors, hence an orthonormal basis for <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>. We’ll construct this reference frame one
vector at a time, thinking about how we can encode the motion of a particle along
the path.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >The first vector of our moving frame will match the “ahead” direction of our analogy:
we want a vector that tells us the direction in which the particle is moving. Since the
velocity vector <script type="math/tex">\vec {x}'(t)</script> points in the direction of instantaneous motion along the path, this
gives us the correct direction for our first vector. However, the velocity vector isn’t
necessarily a unit vector. In order to obtain a unit vector in the same direction as the
velocity vector, we divide <script type="math/tex">\vec {x}'(t)</script> by its length, obtaining the <em>unit tangent vector</em>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {T}(t) = \dfrac {\vec {x}'(t)}{\|\vec {x}'(t)\|}. </script>
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >In the video below, you can see how the unit tangent vector changes as we traverse a
curve. Notice that the unit tangent vector is always pointing in the direction of
motion.
</p>
<div class="video youtube-player" data-youtube="PFYJcjdn35o">_</div>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >For the second vector of our moving frame, we’d like to give the direction in which a
particle moving along the path is turning. This doesn’t quite match up with the
direction “right” from our analogy, since you might be turning to either the left or
the right. Thinking back to our definition of curvature, we were able to see how a
particle was turning by looking at the change in the unit tangent vector.
That is, we considered <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}'(t)</script>. As it turns out, <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}'(t)</script> will always be perpendicular to
<script type="math/tex">\vec {T}(t)</script>.

Proof   </dt><dd 
class="trivlist"></span>Since <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}(t)</script> is a unit vector, we have <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {T}(t)\cdot \vec {T}(t) = \answer {1} </script> for all <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Differentiating both sides of
this equation, we have <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {d}{dt}(\vec {T}(t)\cdot \vec {T}(t)) = \answer {0}. </script> Using properties of derivatives, we then have <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {T}'(t)\cdot \vec {T}(t) + \vec {T}(t)\cdot \vec {T}'(t)=0, </script> so <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {T}'(t)\cdot \vec {T}(t) = 0. </script> This
means that <script type="math/tex">T'(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">T(t)</script> are perpendicular for all <script type="math/tex">t</script>.                                              <script type="math/tex">\blacksquare </script></dd></dl>
</div>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >Since <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}'(t)</script> will always be perpendicular to <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}(t)</script>, it’s a great candidate for the second direction
in our moving frame. However, <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}'(t)</script> won’t always be a unit vector, so we’ll need
to divide by its length to normalize. This gives us the <em>unit normal vector</em>,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {N}(t) = \dfrac {\vec {T}'(t)}{\|\vec {T}'(t)\|}. </script>
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >In the video below, you can see how the unit tangent vector and unit normal vector
change as we traverse a curve. Notice that the unit normal vector is always
perpendicular to the unit tangent vector, and that the unit normal vector points in
the direction that we’re curving.

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Together, the unit tangent vector and unit normal vector span a plane, which we call
the <em>osculating plane</em>. The osculating circle will always lie in the osculating
plane.

third. Let’s think about how many potential candidates there are for the last vector
in our moving frame.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >If we have two orthonormal vectors <script type="math/tex">\vec {v}_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vec {v}_2</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>, how many unit vectors in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script> are
perpendicular to both of these vectors? </p><div class="multiple-choice" id="problem2"><span class="choice  "   id="choice1">0</span> <span class="choice  "   id="choice2">1</span> <span class="choice correct "   id="choice3">2</span> <span class="choice  "   id="choice4">3</span> <span class="choice  "   id="choice5">infinitely many</span> </div>
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >We’ll choose the third and final vector <script type="math/tex">\vec {B}</script> in our moving frame so that respects the right
hand rule with the first two vectors.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >That is, if you take your right hand, point your fingers in the direction of <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}</script>, and curl
your fingers in the direction of <script type="math/tex">\vec {N}</script>, then your thumb will be pointing in the direction of
<script type="math/tex">\vec {B}</script>.
</p>
<div class="video youtube-player" data-youtube="7f0JAqyAsnU">_</div>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Another way to describe the right hand rule is that if you take your right hand,
point your index finger in the direction of <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}</script>, and point your middle finger
in the direction of <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}</script>, then your thumb will be pointing in the direction of
<script type="math/tex">\vec {B}</script>.
</p>

<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >In order to do this, we define the <em>unit binormal vector</em> to be <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \vec {B}(t) = \vec {T}(t)\times \vec {N}(t). </script> What is the relationship
between <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}(t)\times \vec {N}(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vec {N}(t)\times \vec {T}(t)</script>? Select all that apply. </p><div class="select-all" id="problem3"><a

<span class="choice correct "   id="choice10">One is <script type="math/tex">-1</script> times the other.</span>
</div> So, we need to be careful about the order of this cross product, so that we choose
our unit binormal vector consistently.
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >Together, <script type="math/tex">\vec {T}</script>, <script type="math/tex">\vec {N}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vec {B}</script> are three mutually perpendicular unit vectors. They form an
