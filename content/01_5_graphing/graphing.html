<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we’ll cover some approaches for graphing multivariable functions <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>,
focusing on the case where <script type="math/tex">n=2</script>. Before we define the graph of such a function, let’s think
about how we graph a single variable function.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Consider the function <script type="math/tex">f(x) = x^2</script>, which is a function <script type="math/tex">f:\mathbb {R}\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>. The graph of this function is the set of
all points <script type="math/tex">(x,x^2)</script> in the <script type="math/tex">xy</script>-plane, and we draw this graph below.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >We get this set of points by taking each possible input, <script type="math/tex">x\in \mathbb {R}</script>, with its corresponding
output, <script type="math/tex">x^2\in \mathbb {R}</script>. We then plot this point in the <script type="math/tex">xy</script>-plane. So the graph will include points <script type="math/tex">(1,1), (2,4), (\sqrt {pi}, \pi )</script>, and
so on. Notice that for this function, which has domain <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}</script> and codomain <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}</script>, the graph is a
subset of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^2</script>. We’ll keep this in mind as we turn our attention to multivariable
functions.

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >You might already have an intuitive idea of what the graph of a function <script type="math/tex">f:X\subset \mathbb {R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script> should be,
but perhaps don’t know the formal definition, or how to figure out what the graph of
an arbitrary function looks like. We’ll begin with the definition of the graph, before
discussing how to actually produce graphs.

 id="x1-2000"></a>Strategies for Graphing</h3>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >For now, we’ll focus on graphing functions <script type="math/tex">f:X\subset \mathbb {R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>. It can be much trickier to sketch
the graph of such a function than it was to sketch the graphs of functions <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>,
especially since we’ll often be trying to represent a three-dimensional object in a
two-dimensional image. One common strategy that people will initially try is plotting
individual points to try to get a sense of the graph. However, for graphs in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>, you
would need a lot of points to get a representative sample of points. For this reason,
<em>plotting points alone is not an effective strategy</em>. However, plotting a single point here
or there can be helpful.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >We’ve now told you what doesn’t work for graphing functions in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>, so now we should
probably figure out what does work. The essential idea of all of these strategies is
that we know you’re pretty comfortable graphing single variable functions in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^2</script>, so
we’re going to take advantage of that experience.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >We’ll begin with contour curves, which are obtained by setting the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-coordinate to be
constant. Think of this as taking horizontal slices of the graph.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem3"><a 
 id="x1-2001r3"></a>Let <script type="math/tex">f:X\subset \mathbb {R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script> be a function. The <em>contour curve</em> of the function <script type="math/tex">f</script> at height <script type="math/tex">C</script> is the set of
points in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script> obtained by taking the intersection of the graph of <script type="math/tex">f</script> with the plane
<script type="math/tex">z=C</script>.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem4"><a 
 id="x1-2002r4"></a>Consider the function <script type="math/tex">f(x,y) = x^2+y^2</script>. We’ll find the contour curves of this function at heights <script type="math/tex">-1</script>, <script type="math/tex">0</script>, <script type="math/tex">1</script>, <script type="math/tex">2</script>, <script type="math/tex">3</script>,
and <script type="math/tex">4</script>.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >At height <script type="math/tex">-1</script>, we have the set of points <script type="math/tex">(x,y,-1)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x^2+y^2=-1</script>. Since squares are always

set.

So the contour curve at height <script type="math/tex">0</script> is just the set consisting of a single point,
<script type="math/tex">(0,0,0)</script>.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >At height <script type="math/tex">1</script>, we have the set of points <script type="math/tex">(x,y,1)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x^2+y^2=1</script>. We can recognize this as a circle of
radius <script type="math/tex">1</script>.

contour curves.

satisfying <script type="math/tex">C = f(x,y)</script>.
</div>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >After reading this definition, you’re probably thinking “Hey, aren’t contour curves
and level curves the exact same thing?” They’re certainly closely related. The key
difference is that level curves exist in the plane, <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^2</script>, while contour curves exist in
three-space, <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>. Since they’re in the plane, level curves are usually easier to draw.
However, contour curves are more useful for figuring out the shape of a graph. For
these reasons, it can be useful to go back and forth between level curves and contour
curves.

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >So far, we have focused on graphing functions from subsets of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^2</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}</script>, so the graphs are
in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>.
</p><!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >We now turn our attention to the graphs of functions from subsets of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}</script>. Note that
the graph of such a function will exist in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^4</script>. Since the world we live in only has three
physical dimensions, it can be very difficult to visualize a four dimensional
object! Fortunately, there are various tricks that can be used to get some
sense of what a four dimensional object looks like. We cover one of them
here.
</p><!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" >When we had a function <script type="math/tex">f:D\subset \mathbb {R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>, we could get a sense of the graph by looking at its level
curves, which were curves in the same plane.
</p><!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >For a function <script type="math/tex">f:D\subset \mathbb {R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>, we can adopt a similar approach. We can once again consider the
level sets, which are obtained by taking the output to be some constant: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> f(x,y,z) = C. </script> In this case,
the level sets will be level surfaces, which live in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^3</script>. By graphing several level surfaces,
we can see what a slice of the graph of <script type="math/tex">f</script> looks like at various heights, giving us
some sense of how the overall graph behaves. Of course, because this graph
exists in four dimensions, we still probably won’t be able to visualize this
perfectly.
</p><!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >To see how this can help us visualize the four-dimensional graph of a function <script type="math/tex">f:\mathbb {R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb {R}</script>, we
