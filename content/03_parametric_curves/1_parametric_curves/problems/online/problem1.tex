\begin{problem}
Two ants are running on the top of a table. Their paths are described by
\[
\vec{x}(t) = (t^2+1,2t-1)
\]
and
\[
\vec{y}(t) = (\sqrt{t+3}, t),
\]
with coordinates in inches, for $t\geq 0$ in seconds.

At what time do the ants collide?
\[
t = \answer{1}
\]

Where do the ants collide?
\[
(x,y) = \answer{(2,1)}
\]

\end{problem}
