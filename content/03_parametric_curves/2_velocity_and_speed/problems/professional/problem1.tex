\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\vec{x}(t)$ be a path in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with constant length. That is, $\|\vec{x}(t)\|=C$ for some constant $C$ which does not depend on $t$. Prove that $\vec{x}(t)$ and $\vec{x}'(t)$ are perpendicular for all $t$.
\item Consider the path $\vec{y}(t) = (\cos(2t), \sin(2t)\cos(t), \sin(2t)\sin(t))$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}$. Show that $\vec{y}$ lies on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ centered at the origin.
\item Without using the result of part (a), show that $\vec{y}(t)$ and $\vec{y}'(t)$ are always perpendicular, for the path $\vec{y}$ from part (b).
\item Using the result of part (a), show that for any differentiable path $\vec{x}$ which lies on a sphere centered at the origin, the velocity vector is always perpendicular to the position vector.
\end{enumerate}
