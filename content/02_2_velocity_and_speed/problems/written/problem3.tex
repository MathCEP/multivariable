\begin{problem}
Consider the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and consider all lines $l_t$ passing through the point $(1,0)$, indexed by their slopes $t$. For the line of slope $t$, let $\vec{x}(t)$ be the point (other than $(0,1)$) where the line $l_t$ intersects the unit circle.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $\vec{x}(0)$, $\vec{x}(1)$, and $\vec{x}(-1)$.
\item Find an equation for $l_t$.
\item Use your equation for $l_t$ and the equation for the unit circle to find $\vec{x}(t)$ in terms of only $t$.
\item Consider the path $\vec{x}(t)$, for $t\in\mathbb{R}$, given by your answer to (c). What curve does this path parametrize? Are there any ``missing'' points?
\end{enumerate}
