\begin{problem}
Consider the path $\vec{x}(t) = (3t-3^3, 3t^2)$, for $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Graph $\vec{x}$.
\item Find the point $P$ where $\vec{x}$ intersects itself.
\item There are two tangent vectors $\vec{x}$ at $P$, one for each time the path passes through this point. Find the angle between these two vectors.
\end{enumerate}
