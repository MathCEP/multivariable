\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. Prove that $f_{xyzx} = f_{zxxy}$, where these are fourth-order partial derivatives. You are free to use Theorem 4.3 for this problem, but not Theorem 4.5.
\item Verify the result of (a) for the function $f(x,y,z) = x^3y^2z$.
\end{enumerate}
