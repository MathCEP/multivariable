\begin{problem}
Find the polar coordinates of each point, which is given in Cartesian coordinates. Your answers should satify $0\leq r$ and $0\leq \theta < 2\pi$.

$(x,y) = (\sqrt{3},0)$
\[
(r,\theta) = \answer{(\sqrt{3},0)}
\]
$(x,y) = (0,2)$
\[
(r,\theta) = \answer{(2,\pi/2)}
\]
$(x,y) = (-1,-1)$
\[
(r,\theta) = \answer{(\sqrt{2},5\pi/4)}
\]
$(x,y) = (1,\sqrt{3})$
\[
(r,\theta) = \answer{(2,\pi/3)}
\]
