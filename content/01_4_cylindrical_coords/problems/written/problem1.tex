\begin{problem}
Consider the surface described by $(r-3)^2 +z^2 = 1$ in cylindrical coordinates, with the restriction $r\geq 0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the intersection of the surface with the half-plane $\theta = 0$.
\item Sketch the intersection of the surface with the half-plane $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
\item Sketch the intersection of the surface with the plane $z = 0$. 
\item Sketch the surface.
\end{enumerate}
