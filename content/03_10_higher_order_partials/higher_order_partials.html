<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Back in single variable Calculus, we were able to use the second derivative to get
information about a function. For instance, the second derivative gave us valuable
information about the shape of the graph. More specifically, we could use the second
derivative to determine the concavity. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">If <script type="math/tex">f''(x)>0</script> on an interval, then the graph of <script type="math/tex">f</script> is concave up on that interval.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If <script type="math/tex">f''(x)<0</script> on an interval, then the graph of <script type="math/tex">f</script> is concave down on that interval.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If <script type="math/tex">f''</script> changes signs at a point, then the graph of <script type="math/tex">f</script> has an inflection point at
     that point.</li></ul>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, we were able to use second derivative in conjunction with roots of the
first derivative to find local maxima and minima. We could also think about the
second derivative as the rate-of-change of a rate-of-change, or describing some sort of
acceleration or deceleration.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Since the second derivative contains so much useful information, we would like to
come up with a way to define second derivatives for multivariable functions! At first,
this might seem simple: just take the derivative of the derivative. But when we
                                                                  

                                                                  
took the total derivative of a multivariable function <script type="math/tex">f:\mathbb {R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb {R}^n</script>, we got a matrix of
partial derivatives, and it’s not at all clear how we would differentiate a
matrix.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >For now, we’ll settle for defining second order partial derivatives, and we’ll have to
wait until later in the course to define more general second order derivatives.
Fortunately, second order partial derivatives work exactly like you’d expect: you
simply take the partial derivative of a partial derivative.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem1"><a 
 id="x1-1001r1"></a>Consider the function <script type="math/tex">f(x,y) = 2x^2+4xy-7y^2</script>. We’ll start by computing the first order partial derivatives of <script type="math/tex">f</script>,

f_x(x,y) &= \answer{6x+4y}\\
f_y(x,y) &= \answer{4x-14y}
\end{align*}</script>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >We can then compute the second order partial derivatives <script type="math/tex">f_{xx}</script> and <script type="math/tex">f_{yy}</script> by differentiating
with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> again, and with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script> again. </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
f_{xx}(x,y) &= \answer{6}\\
f_{yy}(x,y) &= \answer{-14}
\end{align*}</script>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >However, this isn’t the only way that we could take second order partial derivatives!
We could differentiate with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> first, and with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script> second, to get <script type="math/tex">f_{xy}</script>. We
could also differentiate with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script> first, and with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> second, to get <script type="math/tex">f_{yx}</script>.
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
f_{xy}(x,y) &= \answer{4}\\
f_{yx}(x,y) &= \answer{4}
\end{align*}</script>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Notice that we got the same result for <script type="math/tex">f_{xy}</script> and <script type="math/tex">f_{yx}</script>, so it didn’t end up mattering what
order we took these derivatives in. In turns out that this is not a coincidence, and it’s
a consequence of Clairaut’s Theorem, which we’ll talk about in the next
section.
</div>
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >There are a few different ways that we can denote second order partials. We can
denote the second order partial of <script type="math/tex">f</script> that we get by differentiating with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script>
twice as any of the following. <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> f_{xx}(x,y)\hspace {1cm}\frac {\partial }{\partial x}\left (\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}\right )\hspace {1cm} \frac {\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} </script> For the second order partial of <script type="math/tex">f</script> that we get by
differentiating with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> first, then differentiating with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script>, we denote
this as below. <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> f_{xy}(x,y)\hspace {1cm}\frac {\partial }{\partial y}\left (\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}\right )\hspace {1cm} \frac {\partial ^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} </script> To remember what order to take these derivatives for all
of these notations, start with the variable closest to <script type="math/tex">f</script>, and work your way
out.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >We can similarly define and compute third order partials, fourth order partials, and
so on.

<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >In previous examples, we’ve seen that it doesn’t matter what order you use to take
higher order partial derivatives, you seem to wind up with the same answer no
matter what. This isn’t an amazing coincidence where we randomly chose functions
that happened to have this property; this turns out to be true for many functions.
Clairaut’s Theorem gives us this result.
