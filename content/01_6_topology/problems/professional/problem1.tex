\begin{problem}
Write a careful proof of this statement:

\begin{theorem}
Let $D_1,D_2,...,D_n$ be closed sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then their intersection
\[
D=D_1\cap D_2\cap\cdots\cap D_n
\]
is a closed set as well.
\end{theorem}

For this professional problem, be \emph{very careful} to use notation and definitions correctly. Because you have already seen most of the necessary elements, your proof should be elegant, well-organized, and concise.

\begin{hint}
Take a similar theorem we proved in workshop about open sets, and use De Morgan's Laws for sets. Incidentally, this theorem would still be true even with an intersection of infinitely many closed sets!
\end{hint}
