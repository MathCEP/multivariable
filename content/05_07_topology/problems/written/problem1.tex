Sketch both of the following sets (in two different pictures) and determine whether they are open, closed, neither, or both and whether they are disconnected, connected, and/or simply connected. State all which apply and justify your answer using appropriate definitions and theorems.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $A=\{x^2+y^2<1\}\cup\{x=0\}\subset\mathbb{R}^2$
\item[(b)] $B=\{x^2+y^2=1\}\cup\{x=0\}\subset\mathbb{R}^2$
\end{enumerate}
