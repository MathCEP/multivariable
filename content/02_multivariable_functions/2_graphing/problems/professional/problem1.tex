\begin{problem}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by
\[
g(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2.
\]
Draw at least three level surfaces of $g$, which will be surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. What do you notice about these level surfaces?
\item Suppose you have a function $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ depends on $x$ and $y$, but does not depend on $z$. What can you say about the level surfaces of $g$?
