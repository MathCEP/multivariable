\begin{problem}
Which of the following is the graph of the ellipsoid
\[
\frac{x^2}{9}+ y^2 + \frac{z^2}{4} = 1?
\]

Is there a function $f(x,y)$ such that the graph of $f$ is the ellipsoid above?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
Why is this impossible?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{It wouldn't be one-to-one.}
\choice{It wouldn't be onto.}
\choice{There would be multiple inputs with the same output.}
\choice[correct]{A single input would need to have two outputs.}
\end{multipleChoice}
