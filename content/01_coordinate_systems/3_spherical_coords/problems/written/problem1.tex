\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a function $f$, consider the graphs of the equations $r = f(\theta)$ and $r = 2f(\theta)$, in polar coordinates. How are these graphs related?
\item Given a function $f$, consider the graphs of the equations $\rho = f(\theta, \phi)$ and $\rho = 2f(\theta, \phi)$, in spherical coordinates. How are these graphs related?
\item Given a function $f$, consider the graphs of the equations $r = f(\theta)$ and $r = -f(\theta)$, in polar coordinates. How are these graphs related?
