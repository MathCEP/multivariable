\begin{problem}
(Stolen from webwork) Determine whether the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = (2x\sin y,x^2\cos y + 2y)$ is conservative.

We first compute 
\[
f(x,y)=\int 2x\sin y\, dx = \answer{x^2\sin(y)}+g(y).
\]
\begin{problem}
The partial derivative of the right-hand side with respect to $y$ is
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \answer{x^2\cos(y)}+g'(y).
\]
\begin{problem}
We conclude that
\[
g(y) = \answer{y^2}.
\]
\begin{problem}
The vector field is conservative, and the potential function is
\[
f(x,y) = \answer{x^2\sin(y)+y^2}
\]
